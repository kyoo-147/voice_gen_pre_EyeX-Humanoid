description = """
The <b>SpeechT5</b> model is pre-trained on text as well as speech inputs, with targets that are also a mix of text and speech.
By pre-training on text and speech at the same time, it learns unified representations for both, resulting in improved modeling capabilities.

This space demonstrates the <b>text-to-speech</b> (TTS) checkpoint for the English language.

<b>How to use:</b> Enter some English text and choose a speaker. The output is a mel spectrogram, which is converted to a mono 16 kHz waveform by the HiFi-GAN vocoder. Because the model always applies random dropout, each attempt will give slightly different results.
The <em>Surprise Me!</em> option creates a completely randomized speaker.
